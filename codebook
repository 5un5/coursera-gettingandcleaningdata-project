==================================================================
The experiments were carried out on 30 volunteers, ages 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone on their waist. They captured linear acceleration (XYZ) and angular velocity (XYZ) at 50Hz. 
They randomly partitioned the data into two sets, 70% training data and 30%  for testing.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and sampled. 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components.

Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1], so there are no units.
Each feature vector is a row.
For each record there is:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- An activity label.

The output file for the project is a table with dimensions 6 x 66.
The 6 rows are for the activity types: WALKING,  WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING.
The 66 columns hold the means and standard deviations for these 33 parameters:
tBodyAcc-XYZ      *   1, 2, 3
tGravityAcc-XYZ   *   4, 5, 6
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ  *   7, 8, 9
tBodyGyro-XYZ     *   10, 11, 12
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ *   13, 14, 15
tBodyAccMag           16
tGravityAccMag        17
tBodyAccJerkMag       18
tBodyGyroMag          19
tBodyGyroJerkMag      20
fBodyAcc-XYZ      *   21, 22, 23
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ  *   24, 25, 26
fBodyGyro-XYZ     *   27, 28, 29
fBodyAccMag           30
fBodyAccJerkMag       31
fBodyGyroMag          32
fBodyGyroJerkMag      33

* "XYZ" indicates that parameters for each of the 3 directions: X, Y, and Z.
